### Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a series of machine-learning models that I meticulously worked on between May and August. This span of time was dedicated to mastering the art of crafting efficient and accurate machine-learning solutions. As a passionate learner in the field, I believe in continuous improvement and innovation, which is reflected in the progression of models presented here.
The culmination of this effort resulted in me being awarded a prestigious Machine Learning Certificate from Cornell Tech. This certificate signifies the successful completion of my dedicated learning period and the practical application of machine-learning concepts to real-world problems

### Models
In each folder, there are different types of models.

**Final Project**: Orchestrated a synergy between TF-IDF and Logistic Regression within a structured pipeline, meticulously optimizing hyperparameters via ROC_AUC analysis for an NLP machine learning model.
KNN & Decision Trees: Compiled Jupyter notebooks delineating the progressive acquisition of expertise in K-nearest neighbors and Decision Trees, encapsulating an analytical journey.

**Logistic Regression**: Navigated the nuanced terrain of model selection and intricate logistic regression model optimization techniques.

**Neural Networks**: Leveraged the Keras library to architecturally empower a sentiment analysis model, enabling precise binary classification of book reviews into positive or negative sentiments, exemplifying neural network application.

**Regression Models**: Engaged in a comprehensive study of diverse regression models, acquiring adeptness in strategic model stacking and comparative analysis, underscoring an advanced proficiency in regression methodologies.
